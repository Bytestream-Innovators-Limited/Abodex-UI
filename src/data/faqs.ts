        question: "How does the escrow system work for damage fees?",
        answer: "The Abodex escrow system holds a portion of your rent or a separate deposit as security for potential damages. When you move in, the agreed escrow amount is held in a secure account. If there are no damages at the end of your tenancy, the full amount is returned to you. If damages occur, the landlord can claim from the escrow after providing evidence and getting approval from the estate admin. All transactions are transparent and documented."

The 'Direct Chat' feature enables real-time messaging with end-to-end encryption. You can share documents, photos, and important information through the chat. All conversations are saved for reference, and estate admins can monitor communications to ensure compliance with community guidelines while respecting privacy."

        question: "How does the AI-generated agreement feature work?",

The AI then generates a comprehensive, legally sound agreement that includes appropriate clauses for security deposits, maintenance responsibilities, and termination conditions. The generated agreement is editable, allowing you to make any necessary adjustments before sending it to the tenant for signature."
